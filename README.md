4. Add `include themes/refind-ambience-remix/theme.conf` to the end of `refind.conf`

## Contribution

>Pull requests for more OS icons are welcome. Please make sure the image is a 256x256 solid white png at 75% transparency. To keep alignment consistent the actual icon should be roughly 132x132 in the middle of the png. Depending on the shape of the icon, the size and position may vary to get better results.

Unlike the original repo (see quote above), I would like to put more emphasis on getting wallpapers rather than icons, as there are many icons for use (in my opinion), though more tools icons would be better.
The wallpaper, to work on most systems, should be 2560x1600 PNG format images.
The images should be kept simple like gradients, but complex patterns that do not obstruct the icons will be accepted too.

## Credits

This is a fork of [refind-ambience](https://github.com/lukechilds/refind-ambience); I personally liked the icon-set from that repo.
From the original repo:
>This theme was inspired by [rEFInd-minimal](https://github.com/EvanPurkhiser/rEFInd-minimal) by [@EvanPurkhiser](https://github.com/EvanPurkhiser)

>I don't seem to be able to find an original source for the background image. If you created it, let me know, I'm happy to provide attribution or remove it if it's an issue.
